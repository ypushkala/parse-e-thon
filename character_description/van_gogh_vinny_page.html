            <div class="quirks">
                <h2 class="section-title">Character Quirks</h2>
                <p>Vinny tends to speak in poetic, abstract terms—sometimes, you’ll catch him describing something in a way that sounds more like a line from a poem than an everyday conversation. He also has a habit of sketching quick drawings of things that catch his attention, whether it’s a stranger’s hat or the curve of a building. Sometimes, he’ll even start a painting mid-conversation, not being able to resist the inspiration of the moment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="backstory">
                <h2 class="section-title">Character Backstory</h2>
                <p>Vinny grew up in a bustling city, where he always felt like an outsider, watching the world move quickly around him. His love for art began when he was a young boy, spending hours with his sketchpad, drawing what he saw and felt. Over time, his passion for art grew, and he started experimenting with different mediums. Despite facing doubt from others, he stuck with it, believing that art was his true calling. Today, Vinny spends most of his time in his studio, constantly refining his craft while exploring the depths of the human experience through his work. His art is a reflection of his soul—raw, honest, and full of emotion.</p>
